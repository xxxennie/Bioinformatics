# Course: Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)
## University of California San Diego


This repository contains my progress and solutions for the course "Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)" at the University of California San Diego.

## Course Overview
The "Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)" course is a part of the Algorithms specialization offered by the University of California San Diego. Its primary focus is on the study of genome sequencing techniques and the algorithms used in the field of bioinformatics. The course covers a wide range of topics, including sequence alignment, DNA sequencing technologies, and assembly algorithms.

## Contents
This repository is organized into the following sections:

- Week 1: Introduction to Genome Sequencing
- Week 2: Sequence Alignment Algorithms
- Week 3: Short Read Alignments and Variant Calling
- Week 4: Assembly Algorithms
- Week 5: Genome Scaffolding and Finishing
- Week 6: Final Project

Each week's folder consists of lecture materials, programming assignments, and my solutions.

## Progress
I will be continuously updating and committing my progress, including the code solutions for each week, into the respective folders. You are welcome to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have.

## Getting Started
To access the course materials and programming assignments, kindly refer to the official website of the Algorithms specialization offered by the University of California San Diego.
