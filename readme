# Course: Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)
## University of California San Diego


This repository contains my progress and solutions for the course "Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)". 

## Course Overview
This course is part of the Algorithms specialization offered by the University of California San Diego. It focuses on the study of genome sequencing techniques and algorithms used in bioinformatics. The course covers topics such as sequence alignment, DNA sequencing technologies, and assembly algorithms.

## Contents
The repository is structured as follows:

- Week 1: Introduction to genome sequencing
- Week 2: Sequence alignment algorithms
- Week 3: Short read alignments and variant calling
- Week 4: Assembly algorithms
- Week 5: Genome scaffolding and finishing
- Week 6: Final project

Each week's folder contains the corresponding lecture materials, programming assignments, and my solutions.

## Progress
I will be committing my progress and solution code regularly within the respective week's folder. Please feel free to explore the code and offer any feedback or suggestions.

## Getting Started
To access the course materials and programming assignments, refer to the official website of the Algorithms specialization by University of California San Diego.
